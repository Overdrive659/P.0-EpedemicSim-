#  ☣ P.0-EpedemicSim- ☣
Patient-Zero Epedemic Simulator is a joint work between me and my college to produce our final paper for Gymnasium.

This simulator is the main focus of our paper, we are putting it up to be Demo-ed at the *Borlänge Unga-Forskare Semifinals* before a scientific Jury.
The program is entirely written in **C#**, using the **Unity Game Engine** as a base in which the program runs its simulation and code. 

### Abstract
The Covid-19 pandemic has absorbed many scientific resources in the efforts to understand the characteristics of its nature. The aim of this paper is to create a software program with the purpose of allowing a user to quickly simulate the spread of an airborne disease, in this paper's case, Covid-19, within a given environment. The results are based on the software created within the Unity Game Engine. The software is designed with parameters gathered from various scientific sources on how a virulent airborne diseases spreads between individuals.

The paper shows that creating a program to simulate such a task is not only within the realm of possibility, but also relatively simple. The resulting program can be given input from external scientific sources and output usable data from these given parameters to draw conclusions on the nature of any airborne disease, such as Covid-19. 

Conclusively, there are important deductions that can be made on the simulated model. Things such as how differing levels of surgical mask usage or percentage of vaccinated individuals would affect disease transmission amongst a population. The program gives users a wide variety of different variables to change, which affect the final outcome of the simulation. Each outcome instance can be compared to one another to draw conclusions on the virtually infinite variety of variable combinations.

### Usage
The Unity Project is downloadable from the Prototype-Testing branch of this repository. Once the project is downloaded you can build a version of it on your device. The software is able to be run from inside the Unity Editor as well, but a build is recommended. The resulting data from your simulation will be stored in the StreamingAssets folder, residing inside either the project itself or the build folder, depending on where you are running the program from.
