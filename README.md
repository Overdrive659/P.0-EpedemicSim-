# P.0-EpedemicSim-
Patient-Zero Epedemic Simulator is a joint work between me and my college to produce our final paper for Gymnasium.

This simulator is the main focus of our paper, we are putting it up to be Demo-ed at the Borl√§nge Unga-Forskare Semifinals before a scientific Jury.
The program is entirely written in C#, using the Unity Game Engine as a base in which the program runs its simulation and code. 

### Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic took the world by storm unexpectedly in late 2019, since the start of the outbreak many things have changed, and many things have happened that have changed the publics outlook on diseases. One of the big setbacks that the COVID-19 pandemic caused was the lockdown of Schools across the world. There were many procedures put in place to prevent the disease from spreading in our academic centres, some better than others. The main focus of this project is to give the user an interactive insight into how the disease could spread, using the Authors' school as the target model.
